<div align="center"><strong><span style="font-size:28px;">UNIT TEST QUALITY & COVERAGE REPORT</span></strong></div>

# Scope

This report evaluates unit test coverage and quality across 6 user stories. The scope is restricted to test plans and execution records mapped to these user stories. Analysis excludes non-unit test activities and unrelated defect categories.

**Coverage Boundary:**
- Total number of user stories included in analysis: 6
- These user stories form the baseline for evaluation
- Scope limited to unit test coverage and execution records mapped to these user stories

**Inclusions:**
- Unit test cases linked to the identified user stories
- Test execution results (executed, not executed, passed, failed)
- Defect data directly associated with these user stories

**Exclusions:**
- Integration tests, system tests, or performance tests
- User stories not mapped to test cases
