# UNIT TEST QUALITY & COVERAGE REPORT

---

## 1. Scope

This report evaluates unit test coverage and quality across 5 user stories. The scope is restricted to test plans and execution records mapped to these user stories. Analysis excludes non-unit test activities and unrelated defect categories. The user stories form the baseline reference for measuring coverage, execution success, and defect quality.

---

## 2. Test Coverage Summary

**User Stories Fully Covered:** 2  
**User Stories Partially Covered:** 2  
**User Stories Not Covered:** 1  
**Test Coverage Rate:** 80.00%

### Coverage Gap Details

| User Story ID | Scenario Type | Description | Impact Level |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| US002 | Negative | Invalid input validation not tested | High |
| US003 | Boundary | Edge value conditions not validated | Medium |
| US004 | Functional | No test cases available | High |

---

## 3. Test Execution Summary

**Total Test Cases Executed:** 15  
**Total Test Cases Not Executed:** 5  
**Total Test Cases Passed:** 12  
**Total Test Cases Failed:** 3  
**Execution Success Rate:** 80.00%

### Test Execution Analysis

Execution success rate indicates stable coverage across most user stories with 80% of executed tests passing successfully. Failures are concentrated in boundary condition validations and missing negative scenario coverage. Unexecuted cases suggest gaps in regression readiness, with 25% of total test cases remaining unexecuted across the test suite.

## 4. Defect Details

**Defect Rate:** 15.00%

### Defect Summary Table

| Defect ID | User Story ID | Severity | Defect Category | Root Cause | Impact |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------------|------------|--------|
| D001 | US002 | Critical | Missing Coverage | Negative scenario not tested | High |
| D002 | US003 | Medium | Test Design Gap | Boundary validation missing | Medium |
| D003 | US004 | High | No Coverage | No test cases available | High |

## 5. Quality Scorecard

| User Story ID | Quality Score | Decision | Color |
|---------------|---------------|----------|-------|
| US001 | 88.00% | CONDITIONAL GO | Amber |
| US002 | 76.00% | CONDITIONAL GO | Amber |
| US003 | 80.00% | CONDITIONAL GO | Amber |
| US004 | 48.00% | NO GO | Red |
| US005 | 88.00% | CONDITIONAL GO | Amber |

## 6. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

• **Add unit tests for unvalidated edge conditions in US004** to address no coverage status  
• **Re-execute failed test cases** after resolving critical defect D001 in US002  
• **Implement negative scenario testing for US002** to address invalid input validation gaps  
• **Create comprehensive test cases for US004** to eliminate functional coverage gap

### Short-Term Improvements

• **Strengthen boundary condition validations in US003** to prevent medium-impact defects  
• **Improve test design consistency** across all user stories to reduce test design gaps  
• **Enhance regression coverage** by executing the 5 unexecuted test cases  
• **Refactor test validation logic** to improve overall execution success rate above 85%

## 7. Conclusion

### Summary of Findings

Total of 5 user stories reviewed with 40% fully covered, 40% partially covered, and 20% not covered. Execution success rate of 80.00% and defect rate of 15.00% indicate moderate test quality with significant gaps requiring attention.

### Decision

**CONDITIONAL GO** - Based on aggregated quality scores, the majority of user stories fall within the 70-89% range, with one critical user story (US004) requiring immediate remediation before progression.

### Conclusion Statement

The current unit test suite demonstrates moderate readiness with critical coverage gaps that must be addressed before full progression. Immediate remediation of US004 and resolution of high-impact defects are required to achieve acceptable quality thresholds.
