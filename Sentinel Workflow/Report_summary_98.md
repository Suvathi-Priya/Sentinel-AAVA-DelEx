# **UNIT TEST QUALITY & COVERAGE REPORT**

</div>

# Scope

This report evaluates unit test coverage and quality across 6 user stories. The scope is restricted to test plans and execution records mapped to these user stories.

Analysis excludes non-unit test activities and unrelated defect categories. The baseline for evaluation consists of 90 test cases distributed across SCM-001 through SCM-006 user stories, forming the reference for measuring coverage, execution success, and defect quality.
