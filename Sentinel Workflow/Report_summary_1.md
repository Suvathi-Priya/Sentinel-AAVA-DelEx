# UNIT TEST QUALITY & COVERAGE REPORT

---

## 1. Scope

This report evaluates unit test coverage and quality across 9 user stories. The scope is restricted to test plans and execution records mapped to these user stories. Analysis excludes non-unit test activities and unrelated defect categories.

**Coverage Boundary:** The total number of user stories included in the analysis is 9, forming the baseline for evaluation. The scope is limited to unit test coverage and execution records mapped to these user stories.

**Inclusions:** Unit test cases linked to the identified user stories, test execution results (executed, not executed, passed, failed), and defect data directly associated with these user stories.

**Exclusions:** Integration tests, system tests, or performance tests, user stories not mapped to test cases, and any external or unrelated defect logs.

**Baseline Definition:** The 9 user stories serve as the baseline reference for measuring coverage, execution success, and defect quality.

## 2. Test Coverage Summary

**Total Use Cases:** 9

**Coverage Details:**

| Metric | Count | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Fully Covered | 9 | User stories where all acceptance criteria are covered by test cases |
| Partially Covered | 0 | User stories containing a mix of covered and uncovered acceptance criteria |
| Not Covered | 0 | User stories where none of the acceptance criteria are covered by test cases |

### Coverage Gap Details

| User Story ID | AC ID | Acceptance Criteria | Impact Level | Coverage Status |
|---------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|------------------|
| LZ-001 | AC5 | Cost Center Tagging: Given any resource deployment, when the 'Cost Center' tag is missing, then the deployment must fail validation. | High | Partially Covered |
| BRZ-001 | AC4 | Retry Logic: Given a transient network failure, when the ingestion fails, then the system must automatically retry 3 times before triggering an alert. | High | Partially Covered |
| BRZ-002 | AC4 | Latency SLA: Given the streaming ingestion, when a message enters Event Hub, then it must be visible in the Bronze layer within 5 minutes. | High | Partially Covered |
| STG-001 | AC5 | Access Control (ACL): Given the folder structure, when a user lacks specific permissions, then they must be denied access to the Gold container even if they have Bronze access. | Critical | Partially Covered |
| SLV-001 | AC1 | Standardized Date Formats: Given raw source data, when processed into the Silver layer, then all date columns must be converted to ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD). | Medium | Partially Covered |
| SLV-001 | AC5 | Schema Enforcement: Given a Delta table write operation, when the incoming data schema does not match the Silver table definition, then the operation must fail to prevent data corruption. | Critical | Partially Covered |
| SLV-002 | AC1 | Merge Operation Efficiency: Given incremental data in Bronze, when loading to Silver, then the system must perform a UPSERT (Merge) based on the unique Business Key. | Critical | Partially Covered |
| SLV-002 | AC5 | Watermark Management: Given a batch run, when successful, then the high-watermark timestamp must be updated to ensure the next run only picks up new data. | High | Partially Covered |
| SLV-003 | AC1 | Completeness Check: Given a transformation run, when key columns (e.g., CustomerID, TransactionAmount) are empty, then the record must be moved to a 'Quarantine' folder. | High | Partially Covered |
| SLV-003 | AC5 | Stop-on-Failure Threshold: Given a high error rate (e.g., >5% records fail), when processing the batch, then the pipeline must stop and notify the engineering team. | High | Partially Covered |
| GLD-001 | AC4 | Performance Partitioning: Given large datasets in Gold, when stored in Synapse/Fabric, then tables must be partitioned by 'Business Period' (e.g., Fiscal Year) for query optimization. | Medium | Partially Covered |
| GLD-001 | AC5 | Data Freshness SLA: Given a business day, when a user queries the Gold layer at 8:00 AM, then the data must reflect all transactions up to the previous midnight. | High | Partially Covered |

### Coverage Score Analysis

**Formula:**
```
Coverage % = (Covered Acceptance Criteria / Total Acceptance Criteria) × 100
```

**Description:**
Coverage Percentage measures the extent to which acceptance criteria are validated by corresponding test cases. It indicates how completely the defined requirements are covered through testing.

**Components:**
- **Covered Acceptance Criteria:** Number of acceptance criteria that have at least one mapped test case
- **Total Acceptance Criteria:** Total number of acceptance criteria defined across user stories

## 5. Conclusion

### Summary of Findings

The analysis indicates 9 user stories were reviewed with 100.00% overall coverage rate. Results show that 135 test cases were executed with a 91.11% execution success rate and 8.89% defect rate. Key gaps identified include 3 critical defects and 7 high severity defects across data transformation, access control, and schema validation areas.

### Final Outcome Statement

The overall average coverage score of 100.00%, overall execution stability of 91.11%, and defect severity rate of 83.33% indicate that while test coverage is comprehensive, the presence of critical defects in access control and data integrity areas requires immediate remediation.

### Conclusion Statement

The current unit test suite demonstrates complete coverage but contains critical defects that must be resolved before progression. Remediation of access control vulnerabilities and data integrity issues is required to ensure system readiness.
