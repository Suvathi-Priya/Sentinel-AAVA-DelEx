# UNIT TEST QUALITY & COVERAGE REPORT

## Scope

This report evaluates unit test coverage and quality across 2 user stories. The scope is restricted to test plans and execution records mapped to these user stories. Analysis excludes non-unit test activities and unrelated defect categories.

**Coverage Boundary:** The total number of user stories included in the analysis is 2, forming the baseline for evaluation. The scope is limited to unit test coverage and execution records mapped to these user stories.

**Inclusions:** Unit test cases linked to the identified user stories, test execution results (executed, not executed, passed, failed), and defect data directly associated with these user stories.

**Exclusions:** Integration tests, system tests, performance tests, and user stories not mapped to test cases.

**Baseline Definition:** The 2 user stories serve as the baseline reference for measuring coverage, execution success, and defect quality.

## Conclusion

Remediation is required as test case failures and defects exist in the current test suite. The report indicates outstanding coverage gaps and execution issues that must be addressed before progression.
