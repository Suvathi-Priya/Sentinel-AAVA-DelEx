# UNIT TEST QUALITY & COVERAGE REPORT

## 1. Scope

This report evaluates unit test coverage and quality across 9 user stories. The scope is restricted to test plans and execution records mapped to these user stories. Analysis excludes non-unit test activities and unrelated defect categories.

**Coverage Boundary:** The analysis encompasses 9 user stories containing 45 acceptance criteria, forming the baseline for evaluation. Unit test coverage and execution records are limited to test cases directly mapped to these user stories.

**Inclusions:** Unit test cases linked to the identified user stories, test execution results (executed, not executed, passed, failed), and defect data directly associated with these user stories.

**Exclusions:** Integration tests, system tests, performance tests, user stories not mapped to test cases, and external or unrelated defect logs.

## 2. Test Coverage Summary

**Total Use Cases:** 9

**Coverage Details:**

| Metric | Count | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Fully Covered | 1 | User stories where all acceptance criteria are covered by test cases |
| Partially Covered | 8 | User stories containing a mix of covered and uncovered acceptance criteria |
| Not Covered | 0 | User stories where none of the acceptance criteria are covered by test cases |

### Coverage Gap Details

| User Story ID | AC ID | Acceptance Criteria | Impact Level | Coverage Status |
|---------------|-------|---------------------|--------------|------------------|
| LZ-001 | AC5 | Cost Center Tagging: Given any resource deployment, when the 'Cost Center' tag is missing, then the deployment must fail validation. | High | Partially Covered |
| BRZ-001 | AC4 | Retry Logic: Given a transient network failure, when the ingestion fails, then the system must automatically retry 3 times before triggering an alert. | High | Partially Covered |
| BRZ-002 | AC4 | Latency SLA: Given the streaming ingestion, when a message enters Event Hub, then it must be visible in the Bronze layer within 5 minutes. | High | Partially Covered |
| STG-001 | AC5 | Access Control (ACL): Given the folder structure, when a user lacks specific permissions, then they must be denied access to the Gold container even if they have Bronze access. | Critical | Partially Covered |
| SLV-001 | AC1 | Standardized Date Formats: Given raw source data, when processed into the Silver layer, then all date columns must be converted to ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD). | Medium | Partially Covered |
| SLV-001 | AC5 | Schema Enforcement: Given a Delta table write operation, when the incoming data schema does not match the Silver table definition, then the operation must fail to prevent data corruption. | High | Partially Covered |
| SLV-002 | AC1 | Merge Operation Efficiency: Given incremental data in Bronze, when loading to Silver, then the system must perform a UPSERT (Merge) based on the unique Business Key. | Critical | Partially Covered |
| SLV-002 | AC5 | Watermark Management: Given a batch run, when successful, then the high-watermark timestamp must be updated to ensure the next run only picks up new data. | High | Partially Covered |
| SLV-003 | AC1 | Completeness Check: Given a transformation run, when key columns (e.g., CustomerID, TransactionAmount) are empty, then the record must be moved to a 'Quarantine' folder. | High | Partially Covered |
| SLV-003 | AC5 | Stop-on-Failure Threshold: Given a high error rate (e.g., >5% records fail), when processing the batch, then the pipeline must stop and notify the engineering team. | Medium | Partially Covered |
| GLD-001 | AC4 | Performance Partitioning: Given large datasets in Gold, when stored in Synapse/Fabric, then tables must be partitioned by 'Business Period' (e.g., Fiscal Year) for query optimization. | Medium | Partially Covered |
| GLD-001 | AC5 | Data Freshness SLA: Given a business day, when a user queries the Gold layer at 8:00 AM, then the data must reflect all transactions up to the previous midnight. | High | Partially Covered |

### Coverage Score Analysis

**Formula:** Coverage % = (Covered Acceptance Criteria / Total Acceptance Criteria) × 100

**Description:** Coverage Percentage measures the extent to which acceptance criteria are validated by corresponding test cases. It indicates how completely the defined requirements are covered through testing.

**Components:**
- **Covered Acceptance Criteria:** Number of acceptance criteria that have at least one mapped test case
- **Total Acceptance Criteria:** Total number of acceptance criteria defined across user stories

## 5. Conclusion

### Summary of Findings

The analysis indicates 9 user stories were reviewed with 135 test cases executed. Results show that 1 user story achieved full coverage, 8 user stories demonstrated partial coverage, and 0 user stories remained uncovered. The execution success rate reflects 91.11% with a defect rate of 8.89%.

### Final Outcome Statement

The overall average coverage score of 73.33%, execution stability of 91.11%, and defect severity rate of 75.00% indicate significant gaps requiring remediation. Key gaps identified include 2 critical defects affecting data quality and access control, 7 high-severity defects impacting core functionality, and 3 medium-severity defects affecting performance optimization.

### Conclusion Statement

The current coverage and quality metrics indicate that remediation is required before progression. The unit test suite requires immediate attention to address critical and high-severity defects before deployment readiness can be achieved.
