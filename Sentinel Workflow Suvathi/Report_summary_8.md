# UNIT TEST QUALITY & COVERAGE REPORT

## Scope

This report evaluates unit test coverage and quality across 2 user stories. The scope is restricted to test plans and execution records mapped to these user stories. Analysis excludes non-unit test activities and unrelated defect categories.

**Total User Stories:** 2

The 2 user stories form the baseline for evaluation. The scope is limited to unit test coverage and execution records mapped to these user stories.

**Inclusions:**

- Unit test cases linked to the identified user stories
- Test execution results (executed, not executed, passed, failed)
- Defect data directly associated with these user stories

**Exclusions:**

- Integration tests, system tests, or performance tests
- User stories not mapped to test cases

## Test Coverage Summary

**Coverage Details:**

| Metric | Count | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| Fully Covered | 0 | User stories where all acceptance criteria are Fully Covered |
| Partially Covered | 2 | User stories containing one or more Partially Covered acceptance criteria |
| Not Covered | 0 | User stories where all acceptance criteria are Not Covered |

**Overall Coverage Score:** 60.0%

## Formula Analysis for Overall Coverage Score

**Metric Value:** 60.0%

**Formula:** `(fully_covered_acceptance_criterias_in_all_user_stories / total_acceptance_criterias_in_all_user_stories) × 100`

**Description:** Overall Coverage Score measures the percentage of fully covered acceptance criterias across all user stories.

**Components:**

- fully_covered_acceptance_criterias_in_all_user_stories: 6
- total_acceptance_criterias_in_all_user_stories: 10
- overall_coverage_score_calculation: `(6 / 10) × 100 = 60.00`

**Coverage Gap Details:**

| User Story ID | AC ID | Coverage Gap Reason | Coverage Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| CLP-001 | AC5 | No testcase explicitly validates fraud review requirement. | Partially Covered |
| CNS-001 | AC4 | No testcase explicitly validates timestamp capture in notification logs. | Partially Covered |
| CNS-001 | AC5 | No testcase explicitly validates the retry limit of 3 times. | Partially Covered |

**Coverage Score:**

| User Story ID | Coverage Score | Color |
|---|---:|---|
| CLP-001 | 80.00% | 🟠 Amber |
| CNS-001 | 40.00% | 🔴 Red |

## Test Execution Summary

**Overall Test Execution Summary:**

- Total Test Cases Executed: 28
- Total Test Cases Passed: 22
- Total Test Cases Failed: 6

| User Story ID | Total Test Cases | Executed | Passed | Failed |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| CLP-001 | 13 | 15 | 12 | 3 |
| CNS-001 | 15 | 13 | 10 | 3 |

## Consistency Analysis

**Data Mapping Inconsistency Details:**

| Test Case ID | Consistency Type | Description | User Story ID | AC ID | Impact Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| UT_CLP_014 | missing_testcase | Mapped testcase definition is missing for testcase ID: UT_CLP_014 | CLP-001 | AC5 | High |
| UT_CLP_015 | missing_testcase | Mapped testcase definition is missing for testcase ID: UT_CLP_015 | CLP-001 | AC5 | High |
| UT_CNS_014 | missing_testlog | Execution log is missing for testcase ID: UT_CNS_014 | CNS-001 | AC5 | Medium |
| UT_CNS_015 | missing_testlog | Execution log is missing for testcase ID: UT_CNS_015 | CNS-001 | AC5 | Medium |

**Consistency Metrics Summary:**

| Metric | Count |
|---|---|
| Total Test Cases | 28 |
| Total Test Logs | 28 |
| Missing Test Cases | 2 |
| Missing Test Logs | 2 |
| Consistency Status | Mismatch Detected |

## Defect Details

**Defect Rate:** 21.43%

## Formula Analysis for Defect Rate

**Metric Value:** 21.43%

**Formula:** `(total_defects_in_all_test_logs / total_test_cases_in_all_test_plan) × 100`

**Description:** Defect Rate measures the proportion of defects identified during testing relative to the total number of test cases.

**Components:**

- total_defects_in_all_test_logs: 6
- total_test_cases_in_all_test_plan: 28
- overall_defect_rate_calculation: `(6 / 28) × 100 = 21.43`

| Defect ID | Test Case ID | User Story ID | Defect Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEF-CLP-001 | UT_CLP_003 | CLP-001 | Points posting service delay |
| DEF-CLP-002 | UT_CLP_008 | CLP-001 | Balance refresh cache issue |
| DEF-CLP-003 | UT_CLP_015 | CLP-001 | Redemption workflow synchronization issue |
| DEF-CNS-001 | UT_CNS_004 | CNS-001 | SMS gateway timeout prevents delivery |
| DEF-CNS-002 | UT_CNS_006 | CNS-001 | SMS tracking service failed to update status |
| DEF-CNS-003 | UT_CNS_009 | CNS-001 | Push notification service unavailable |

## Conclusion

Remediation is required as test case failures and defects exist in the current test suite. The report indicates outstanding coverage gaps and execution issues that must be addressed before progression.
